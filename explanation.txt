each player has a neural network(brain)
with inputs so that it can predict how to move.
the inputs pass through the hidden layers with leaky relu activation and then softsign outputs(scaled)
it outpus a value -1 to 1 and if it is above or below a threshold it moves.
after the points to win are reached the nets mutate using an evolutionary algorithm-
if it has a top fitness it doesnt mutate otherwise it does based on how high the fitness is,
fitness is calculated by how many times it hits the ball (and if it doesnt, rewards it based on distance to the ball) and points won

over time it will get better and mutate less
